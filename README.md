# Tracking code generator using Hyperledger Fabric 1.4

## Blockchain

This project has been initiated as a proposal for establishing a normalized tracking code generator adapted for Brazilian Logistics. It's aiming at creating standardized tracking code for identifying assets during delivery process.

#### Why blockchain ?
Blockchain is a distributed and decentralized database for the registration of information that can not be modified. It makes it a perfect choice for fast, secure and reliable medium of exchange. We believe it could revolutionize how data are exchanged within Logistics. By creating a network of trusted Nodes, this solution could bring an answer for generating trustworthy and secure tracking code.


## Tutorial

A tutorial explaining the whole functioning of the chaincode is available at this [Link](https://medium.com/@jojoooo/write-your-first-hyperledger-fabric-1-4-chaincode-bab3c484c35a)

## Use

A specific [Fabric dev-mode environment](https://github.com/Jojoooo1/dev-mode-environment) has been created for rapid code/build/run/debug cycle

## Tests

```bash
npm run test
```

## Demo
